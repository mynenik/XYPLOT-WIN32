README for xyplot for Windows source code distribution
Rev. 8/23/03

The project files are for use with Symantec C++ 7.5.
In addition, the A386 assembler is used to assemble
the kForth virtual machine, vm.asm --- however, the
assembled file vm.obj is provided for those who do
not want or need to modify vm.asm. 

Since SC++ 7.5 has been obsolete for some time, we
expect to migrate to the Digital Mars C++ compiler
in the near future. When this occurs, an announcement
will be posted on the xyplot page at

     http://ccreweb.org/software/xyplot/xyplot.html

Questions about the code may be addressed to
